# Why Cap over Cloudflare Turnstile and other CAPTCHAS?

* **Why use this over Turnstile:** Cloudflare Turnstile is known for having an extremely high error rate, especially for users using private browsers such as Brave or Librewolf. Also, Cap is open-source.

* **Why use this over RECAPTCHA:** Cap is significantly smaller and faster than RECAPTCHA, open-source, fully free and  doesn't require you checking traffic signs due to its PoW nature.

* **Why use this over hCAPTCHA:** Not only is Cap's bundle 250x smaller than hCAPTCHA, it's open-source and doesn't require you checking traffic signs

* **Why use this over Altcha:** Cap is slightly smaller than altcha and easier to integrate, but if you don't care about that and want a more mature solution I would highly recommend checking it out.

* **Why use this over FriendlyCaptcha:** Unlike FriendlyCaptcha, Cap is free & open-source (FriendlyCaptcha is â‚¬39/month for 5,000 requests and 5 domains) and has a smaller footprint.

* **Why use this over MTCaptcha:** Cap is more lightweight, doesn't rely on users solving an image puzzle that AIs like GPT-4o can solve, is open-source, more private and doesn't depend on third-party servers for verification.

* **Why use this over GeeTest:** Cap doesn't require an account or API keys, has no usage limits, and is completely open-source with a simpler integration process. It also doesn't rely on slow, complex image-based puzzles that frustrate users
