# Alternatives to Cap

## Cloudflare Turnstile

Cloudflare Turnstile is a great alternative to Cap, but unfortunately it is known for having an extremely high error rate, especially for users using private browsers such as Brave or Librewolf. Also, unlike Turnstile, Cap is open-source.

## reCAPTCHA
Not only is Cap significantly smaller and faster than RECAPTCHA, it's open-source, fully free and is significantly more private than RECAPTCHA. Cap doesn't require you to check traffic signs or solve puzzles, and it doesn't track users or collect data.

Also, reCAPTCHA's audio challenge can be solved by bots like Gemini 2.0 quite easily.

## hCAPTCHA
hCAPTCHA is also a pretty great alternative to Cap, and I recommend it if you don't want to use PoW, altough Cap's bundle 250x+ smaller than hCAPTCHA, is open-source and doesn't require you checking traffic signs.

## Altcha
Cap is slightly smaller than altcha and easier to integrate, but if you don't care about that and want a more mature solution I would highly recommend checking it out.

## FriendlyCaptcha

Unlike FriendlyCaptcha, Cap is free & open-source (FriendlyCaptcha is â‚¬39/month for 5,000 requests and 5 domains) and has a smaller bundle size.

## MTCaptcha
Cap is more lightweight, doesn't rely on users solving an image puzzle that LLMs and OCR can easily solve, is open-source, more private and doesn't depend on third-party servers for verification.

## GeeTest

Cap doesn't require an account or API keys, has no usage limits, and is completely open-source with a simpler integration process. It also doesn't rely on slow and complex puzzles that can usually be solved by LLMs.

## Arkose Labs

let's not get over how ridiculous funcaptcha is lmao like what even are those challenges
