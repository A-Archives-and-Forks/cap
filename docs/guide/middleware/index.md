# About checkpoints/Middlewares

Cap's Checkpoints allow you to replicate Cloudflare's browser check interstitial. This helps prevent all bots, and automated abuse before they ever reach your website, not only submitting forms.

They're extremely simple to set up and use, with you only having to add a few lines of code to your server, unlike moving your entire website over to cloudflare.

Note that this is kind of a nuclear solution, as it _will_ also impact good bots such as search engine crawlers.
