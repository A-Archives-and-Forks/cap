## Why Cap?

- ⚡️ **250x smaller than hCaptcha**  
  Cap's widget library is extremely small, only 12kb minified and brotli'd.
- 🔒️ **Private**  
   Cap's usage of proof-of-work eliminates the need for any tracking, fingerprinting or data collection.
- 🌈 **Fully customizable**  
   Cap is self-hostable so you can customize both the backend & frontend — or you can just use CSS variables
- 🤖 **PoW-based**  
   Cap uses proof-of-work instead of complex puzzles, making it easier for humans and harder for bots
- 🧩 **Standalone mode**  
   Cap offers a standalone mode with Docker, allowing you to use it with languages other than JS.
- 💨 **Invisible mode**  
   Cap can run invisibly in the background using a simple JS API.
- ☁️ **Floating mode**  
   Floating mode keeps your CAPTCHA hidden until it's needed
- 🌳 **Fully FOSS**  
   Completely open source under AGPL-3.0, with no premium versions.
